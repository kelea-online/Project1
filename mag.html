        <h2>Top Song</h2>
        <p>I played <strong>8 018</strong> songs this year. However, there's one song on top of my list which I played over, and over, and over again...</p>
        <h3>HERMÈS by DJ Clen featuring A-Reece, Maraza and Jay Jody</h3>

        <p>The music pulsed through the air at Reece Effect, a music festival celebrating the South African hip-hop artist A-Reece. It was April 2024, and I was experiencing the raw emotion of the live performance for the first time in a while. Little did I know, as I swayed and sang along, a skilled hand was already reaching into my man bag, deftly removing my phone without my notice. The thrill of the music was quickly overshadowed by the sinking realization of my loss. The joy of the moment, tainted by the sting of theft.</p>
        <p>Yet, even in the face of this minor setback, the music held its power. It was a reminder of the resilience of the human spirit, the ability to find joy amidst adversity. The song, with its poignant lyrics and infectious rhythm, became a symbol of that resilience. And so, I turned to the song for solace immediately after it dropped, pressing play <strong>46 times</strong> over the following weeks. Each listen was a journey back to that April evening with it performed live, a bittersweet reminder of the low of night. The music, once a source of pure joy, now carried the weight of both the memory and loss of uninsured smartphone device.</p>
